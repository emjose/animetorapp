#  Welcome to the World of Benders! Its been 100 years since the last Avatar has vanished.
#  The Avatar is needed to restore balance amongst the five nations of the World: Air, Water, Earth, Fire, and Code!
#  After the disappearance of the Avatar, the Code Benders launched a full lab attack, 
#  in an effort to spread code around the world.
#  Use this divination test to discover who you are, and
#  build a team of Benders to defeat the labs and restore balance to the World!

########### different ways to write your seeds ############







# 1: save everything to variables (makes it easy to connect models, best for when you want to be intentional about your seeds)
basil = Plant.create(name: "basil the herb", bought: 20200610, color: "green")
sylwia = Person.create(name: "Sylwia", free_time: "none", age: 30)
pp1 = PlantParenthood.create(plant_id: basil.id, person_id: sylwia.id, affection: 1_000_000, favorite?: true)

# 2. Mass create -- in order to connect them later IN SEEDS (not through the app) you'll need to find their id
## a. by passing an array of hashes:







Plant.create([
    {name: "Corn Tree", bought: 20170203, color: "green"},
    {name: "Prayer plant", bought: 20190815, color: "purple"},
    {name: "Cactus", bought: 20200110, color: "ugly green"}
])
## b. by interating over an array of hashes:
plants = [{name: "Elephant bush", bought: 20180908, color: "green"},
    {name: "Photos", bought: 20170910, color: "green"},
    {name: "Dragon tree", bought: 20170910, color: "green"},
    {name: "Snake plant", bought: 20170910, color: "dark green"},
    {name: "polka dot plant", bought: 20170915, color: "pink and green"},
    {name: "Cactus", bought: 20200517, color: "green"}]

plants.each{|hash| Plant.create(hash)}






# 3. Use Faker and mass create
## step 1: write a method that creates a person
def create_person
    free = ["mornings", "evenings", "always", "afternoons", "weekends", "none"].sample

    person = Person.create(
        name: Faker::Movies::HitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy.character,
        free_time: free,
        age: rand(11...70)
    )
end

## step 2: write a method that creates a joiner
def create_joiners(person)
    plants_number = rand(1..4)
    plants_number.times do 
        PlantParenthood.create(
            plant_id: Plant.all.sample.id, 
            person_id: person.id, 
            affection: rand(101), 
            favorite?: [true, false].sample
        )
    end
end

## step 3: invoke creating joiners by passing in an instance of a person
10.times do     
    create_joiners(create_person)
    ##### ALTERNATIVE:
    # person = create_person
    # create_joiners(person)
end

indoor = Category.create(name: "indoors")

Plant.update(category_id: indoor.id)
